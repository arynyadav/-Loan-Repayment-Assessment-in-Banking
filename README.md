# Loan Repayment Assessment in Banking Data Science Project

This GitHub repository contains a data science project focused on assessing loan repayment using machine learning models. The project aims to predict whether a customer will repay a loan based on various features and historical data.

### Project Overview
In this project, we leverage data science techniques to analyze banking data and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan repayment. By utilizing historical loan data, we aim to develop models that assist in making informed lending decisions.

### Key Features
- Data Exploration: Explore and understand the dataset, identify patterns, and preprocess data for modeling.
  
- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that enhance model performance and capture loan repayment behavior.

- Model Building: Develop machine learning models to predict loan repayment, considering various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

- Deployment: Showcase the deployment of the best-performing model for practical use in loan approval systems.



### Usage
Follow the instructions provided in the notebooks to preprocess the data, engineer features, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. Additionally, refer to the README.md file for detailed usage instructions and project documentation.
